  <h2 id= "header">About Me:</h2>
  <p id="about_me">
    If you ask me what does a perfect night look like it’s like this: It’s midnight and I’m heavily caffeinated typing away until the sun rises. Write down the logic, type the code, compile the code, find bugs if any, and repeat. A simple process really, but complicated in practice. There’s a satisfaction to writing down instructions and having a computer obey without question, assuming those questions aren’t runtime errors. As a programmer I love solving puzzles, especially difficult ones. The state of euphoria you achieve when you solve a difficult bug that you were stuck on for hours is comparable to beating a boss in dark souls. Not saying every bug is as tough as the Nameless king, but more like The Champion from the beginning of the game. These nights are essential to my skills, these practice lessons are what helps me get good (“git gud” Like how the Dark Souls community would put it).

  <h2 id="header_two">What Do I do?</h2>
  <p id="what_do_i_do">
    What should I build? An app? A website? Maybe a program that helps me farm items in Sekiro (A video game similar to Dark Souls). I will build anything that can make my life easier, that’s the beauty of programming. Don’t feel like doing a repetitive task? Cool then don’t, let the computer do it for you. We live in the twenty first century and I plan to live like we do. Why not build a unique calculator for my Statistics class? Share this calculator app with my friends in class. Not only should I make my life easier, but also those of my classmates.

  <h2 id="header_three">My Passions: </h2>
  <p = id="passions">
    When it comes to programming I love mobile development. Having your own custom-built app on your phone makes me feel like Tony Stark from Iron Man. Especially when that app solves a personal problem or inconvenience for me. Java is my go-to language for android development and Objective-c is my go-to for IOS development. Both are great languages with extensive libraries that helps you to finish your app as fast as possible. Besides programming I love playing strategy games; games such as Total War, Civilization, and Dark Souls.
